						<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Cards as Payment Methods.</B> By adding a debit card, credit card or prepaid card as a Payment Method, you are providing DinarPal with continuous authority to automatically charge that card to obtain the relevant funds when the card is used as a Payment Method pursuant to this Agreement. You can stop the continuous authority in respect of any card by removing that card as a Payment Method in your Account Profile.<BR> <BR>
                               <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Preferred Payment Method. </B>You may select a Preferred Payment Method each time you make a payment, except for a Preapproved Payment or a No Log-In Payment.
For a Preapproved Payment and, in most instances, a No Log-In Payment, you can select a Preferred Payment Method when you provide your initial authorization for this payment and through the My Preapproved Payments section of your Account Profile.
If you select a Preferred Payment Method but have available balance in your Account, your balance will be used to fund your payment. If eCheck is your Preferred Payment Method, it will be used to fund your DinarPal payment, even if you have a balance. DinarPal may limit the Payment Methods available for a transaction.

							   <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Refused and Refunded Payments.</B> When you send a payment, the recipient is not required to accept it.

							   <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Merchant Processing Delay. </B>When you send a payment to certain Merchants, you are providing an Authorization to the Merchant to process your payment and complete the transaction. The payment will be held as pending until the Merchant processes your payment. Some Merchants may delay processing your payment. In such an instance, your Authorization will remain valid for up to 30 Days. If your payment requires a currency conversion, the exchange rate will be determined at the time the Merchant processes your payment and completes the transaction.<BR> <BR>
							
							
							   <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Preapproved Payments.</B> A Preapproved Payment is a payment in which you Authorize a Merchant to directly charge your Account on a one-time, regular, or sporadic basis. Preapproved Payments are sometimes called "subscriptions", "recurring payments”, “preauthorized transfers” or "automatic payments". Within two (2) Business Days of any Preapproved Payment made from your Account, you will receive a confirmation of this transaction by email.<BR> <BR>
							   <ol type="a">
								<li><B>Notice for Certain Preapproved Payments.</B> If a Preapproved Payment will vary in amount and is made using an Instant Transfer, eCheck, debit card Payment Method or your Balance, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the Merchant at least 10 Days before the transfer is made. If the Merchant provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your Preapproved Payment will fall outside a range established between you and the Merchant. This notice is designed to protect you from having insufficient funds in your bank account to cover the Preapproved Payment.</li>

							   <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Stopping a Preapproved Payment.</B> You may stop a Preapproved Payment at any time up to 3 Business Days prior to the date the next payment is scheduled to be made by notifying DinarPal. To stop a Preapproved Payment, access the My Preapproved Payments section of your Account Profile and follow the links to stop the payment. You may also stop a Preapproved Payment by calling DinarPal at 012-2228069 (Malaysia). Once you contact DinarPal to stop a Preapproved Payment, all future payments under your agreement with the Merchant will be stopped. If you stop a Preapproved Payment you may still be liable to the Merchant for the payment or for other penalties under the terms of your agreement with the Merchant and you may be required to pay the Merchant through alternative means. We will be liable for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any Preapproved Payment if you have followed the instructions in this section to notify us.<BR> <BR>

You agree to allow DinarPal to recover any amounts due to DinarPal by debiting your balance. If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, you must reimburse DinarPal through other means.

									 <ol type="a">
								       <li>You should immediately notify DinarPal if you believe:

										 <li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction or unauthorized access to your Account;</li>
										 <li>there is an Error in your Account history statement (you can access your Account history by logging into your Account and clicking on a link to “View all of my transactions” ) or in your transaction confirmation sent to you by email;</li>
										 <li>your password or DinarPal Mobile PIN has been compromised;</li>
										 <li>your DinarPal Mobile-activated phone has been lost, stolen or deactivated; or</li>
										 <li>you need more information about a transaction listed on the statement or transaction confirmation.</li>
										</ol>
										</li>
										<BR>
										 <li>To be eligible for protection for Unauthorized Transactions, you must notify us within 60 Days after any Unauthorized Transaction first appears in your Account history statement. We will extend the 60 Day time period if a good reason, such as a hospital stay, kept you from notifying us within 60 Days.

You should regularly log into your Account and review your Account history statement to ensure that there has not been an Unauthorized Transaction or Error. DinarPal will also send an email to the primary email address you have provided in order to notify you of each transaction from your Account. You should also review these transaction confirmations to ensure that each transaction was authorized and is accurate. 
                                        
										<BR><BR> For Unauthorized Transactions or Errors in your Account, notify us as follows:
									    <ol type="1">
										 <li>Use this form to file a report in the DinarPal Resolution Center; or</li>
										 <li>Write to DinarPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, Suite 15 MITC Commercial Street, 75450 Ayer Keroh Melaka;  or</li>
										 <li>Call DinarPal Customer Service at +60 112 222 8069</li>
										</ol>

										<BR> When you notify us, provide us with all of the following information:
									    <ol type="1">
										 <li>Your name and email address registered to your Account;</li>
										 <li>A description of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error and an explanation as to why you believe it is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the transaction; and</li>
										 <li>The amount of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error.</li>
										</ol>
										</li>
										<BR>
										If you notify us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days. During the course of our investigation, we may request additional information from you. </li>

										  <li>We will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notification of the suspected Unauthorized Transactions or Error. If your Account is new (the first transaction from your Account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete this investigation. If we need more time, we may take up to 45 Days to complete our investigation (or up to 90 Days for new Accounts, or if your transaction was at a point of sale where you were physically present, or a foreign initiated transaction).
										  <li>If we decide that we need more time to complete our investigation, we will provisionally credit your Account for the amount of the suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error. You will receive the provisional credit within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notice (or 20 Business Days for new Accounts). This will allow you to have use of the money until we complete the investigation. We will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days (or 20 Business Days for new Accounts), we will not provisionally credit your Account.
									      <li>We will inform you of our decision within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.

If we determine that there was an Unauthorized Transaction or Error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your Account within 1 Business Day of our determination. Or, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.

								    <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Actions by DinarPal – Restricted Activities.</B> If DinarPal, in its sole discretion, believes that you may have engaged in any Restricted Activities, we may take various actions to protect DinarPal, Affiliates other Users, other third parties or you from Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The actions we may take include but are not limited to the following:</i><BR><BR>
									<ol type="a">
								       <li>We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or the DinarPal Services;</li><BR>
									   <li>We may suspend your eligibility  for DinarPal Buyer Protection and/or DinarPal Seller Protection;</li><BR>
									   <li>We may refuse to provide the DinarPal Services to you now and in the future; and </li><BR>
									   <li>We may hold your funds for a period of time reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to DinarPal or a third party, or if we believe that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions.</li><BR><BR>
									</ol>
									
									<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Actions by DinarPal - Holds.</B> </i><BR><BR>
								   
									<ol type="a">
								       <li><B>Risk-Based Holds. </B> DinarPal, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on any or all of the payments you receive when DinarPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions. DinarPal’s determination may be based on different factors and DinarPal may rely on information it receives from third parties. If DinarPal places a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your “pending balance” and the payment status will indicate the hold, for example it can show as “Completed - Funds not yet available.” If DinarPal places a hold on any or all of the payments you receive, DinarPal will provide you with notice of our actions. DinarPal will release the hold on any payment after 30 Days from the date the payment was received into your Account unless DinarPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment such as (a) the receipt of a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback, or Reversal, (b) DinarPal believes that you have violated the terms of this Agreement or any other Policy and that such a violation results in the need to continue holding the funds, or (c) DinarPal believes that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions. In such an event, DinarPal may continue holding the payment in your Account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement. DinarPal, in its sole discretion, may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, for example when you upload tracking information of the item you shipped.</li><BR>
									   <li><B>Disputed Transaction Holds. </B> If a User files a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback or Reversal on a payment you received, DinarPal may place a temporary hold on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of the liability. If you win the dispute or the transaction is eligible for DinarPal Seller Protection, DinarPal will lift the temporary hold. If you lose the dispute, DinarPal will remove the funds from your Account. This process also applies to any claim that a buyer files directly with eBay through the eBay Money Back Guarantee program, provided that your Account is your reimbursement method for amounts you owe to eBay or to the buyer (as the case may be) under the terms of the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.</li><BR>
									  
									</ol>
									
									<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Actions by DinarPal - Reserves.</B>
DinarPal, in its sole discretion, may place a Reserve on funds held in your Business Account when DinarPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with your Account. If DinarPal places a Reserve in your Account, transactions will be shown as "pending" in your DinarPal balance, and you will not have access to funds in a “pending” status until they are cleared. If your Account is subject to a Reserve, DinarPal will provide you with notice specifying the terms of the Reserve. The terms may require that a certain percentage of the amounts received into your Account are held for a certain period of time, or that a certain amount of money is held in Reserve, or anything else that DinarPal determines is necessary to protect against the risk associated with your Account. DinarPal may change the terms of the Reserve at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms.
</i><BR><BR>
									<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Actions by DinarPal - Account Closure, Termination of Service, Limited Account Access; Confidential Criteria.</B> DinarPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and/or access to the DinarPal Services for any reason and at any time upon notice and payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your balance. If we limit access to your Account, including through a Reserve or hold, we will provide you with notice of our actions, and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate. Further, you acknowledge that DinarPal’s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to your Account, placing holds or imposing Reserves, may be based on confidential criteria that is essential to our management of risk, the security of Users’ Accounts and the DinarPal system. You agree that DinarPal is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management or its security procedures to you.</B> </i><BR><BR>
									<i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Acceptable Use Policy Violations. </B> If you violate the Acceptable Use Policy then in addition to the above actions you will be liable to DinarPal for the amount of DinarPal’s damages for each violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You agree that $2,500.00 USD (or equivalent) per transaction in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of DinarPal’s actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to DinarPal that reasonably could be anticipated because due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. DinarPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in the offending Account, or any other Account you control.</i><BR><BR>
